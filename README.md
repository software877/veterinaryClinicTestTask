# A small veterinary clinic is in need of an application to allow their users to contact them easily and for them to provide information to their users about their pets. 
# Implement this app with the following requirements:

- Fetch the config.json to check for chat and call feature availability and work hours
- Call and/or chat buttons are at the top (see wireframe)
- Office hours is displayed below the call and chat buttons
- If both the chat and call features are disabled, do not show the corresponding buttons
- Tapping on either buttons should display an alert with the following message
	- if within work hours: “Thank you for getting in touch with us. We’ll get back to you as soon as possible”
	- if outside work hours: “Work hours has ended. Please contact us again on the next work day”
- Fetch the pets.json for pet information to display on the screen
- Each pet information is presented in a cell with Image and title
- Tapping on a pet info cell would open a new screen that loads the pet information on a webview
- Views should adjust to orientation and screen size accordingly


**DOs**
